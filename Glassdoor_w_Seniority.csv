The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.

IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems.

Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, Storyblocks has been recognized as one of Washington D.C.'s Top Workplaces by The Washington Post, among the Best Places to Work by the Washington Business Journal, and by the Washingtonian as one of DC's 50 Great Places to Work.

COVID-19 Update:

Storyblocks has adjusted to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a flexible, work-from-home environment. All employees are free to work from wherever they like through at least June 2021 (or later depending on vaccine rollouts).

Who You Are:

We're looking for an Data Analyst to help us deliver business intelligence and insights to every function of the organization! The right candidate will have deep analytical and visualization expertise with experience in B2B sales analytics. If you're excited by the opportunity to get exposure to multiple problem spaces filled with challenging and interesting questions to solve with data, this is a role for you!

What You'll Do:

Thought Partnership

Storyblocks structures its teams using a squad model (i.e. a cross-functional team) in which our analysts collaborate directly with a Product Manager, a Product Designer, and Engineers to make an impact on the business. As an analyst on a squad, that means you will:
contribute to high-level strategic conversations within your squad and throughout the company
work with your squad lead to ask and answer important questions that drive value for our business by improving our understanding of our customers and product
set up reporting to measure your squad's performance while also using your expertise to inform which metrics to track
use data to identify and own high-value problem spaces within your squad's purview
work with your squad lead to drive iterative development, designing experiments to test hypotheses, analyzing the results, and building on the knowledge gained
estimate impact to inform prioritization decisions and tradeoffs
Core Analytics

At Storyblocks, you'll use your analytical prowess to its fullest extent. That means you will:
develop and maintain data-driven reporting and dashboards
extract, clean, transform, and visualize data to inform business decisions
suggest and implement improvements to data infrastructure
break down and solve difficult problems with data
use both databases and distributed computing technologies to manipulate data
perform statistical analyses to determine significance and help stakeholders make decisions
What You Bring to the Table:

Required
3+ years of hands-on analytics experience manipulating large, complex data sets
1+ years working with B2B sales teams
Expertise in data manipulation, ideally using at least one of SQL, Python, or R
Experience working with B2B tools (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
Experience with data visualization or dashboarding
Comfort breaking down and attacking open ended problems
Team player that can collaborate and communicate with people across all levels and functions
Preferred
Experience leading projects or managing others
Experience with executive-level reporting
Familiarity with A/B Testing and statistical techniques
What We Bring to the Table:
Competitive and fair compensation: We believe in fair pay--equal pay for equal work. For each title, we have consistently applied competitive salary bands based on market data and benchmarks. What you've been paid before, fear of conflict, or willingness to negotiate does not play a part.
Company-paid medical: Our medical, dental and vision premiums are covered 100% for you and your dependents.
Paid parental leave: Welcoming new family members is exciting, but it can also be challenging. We offer twelve weeks paid leave for primary caregivers and four weeks for secondary caregivers. Additionally, we have a dedicated private nursing room available to new parents.
Unlimited vacation: At Storyblocks we take vacation seriously. That means take the time off when you need it. Don't worry about tracking hours or accounting for partial days. Typically employees take about three or four weeks each year.
Flexible work-from-home options: Much of our workflow is online, and for meetings, we have dedicated video-conferencing setups. As long as you deliver results, you are welcome to get your work done outside of the office or during unusual times when desired.
Company-sponsored mentorship and growth: We have a formal mentorship program that involves regular career and growth conversations. ""360-degree"" feedback is collected twice a year and synthesized into actionable, peer-reviewed, performance reviews. We happily foot the bill for conferences and online courses that will add value to the organization. We encourage attending meetups and are happy to host them as well.
Casual Work Environment: Sure we all get dressed up once in a while, but in general we want you to be comfortable at the office – whatever that means to you (flip-flops, shorts, jeans, etc.).
Fully stocked kitchen: Everyone gets input on the food and drinks we stock in our shared refrigerators and snack room. We have multiple mechanisms for making coffee and cold-brew kegs are often on tap.
Dogs in the office: We love dogs and we will probably love your dog too. With help from a calendar, we allow employees to bring in their dogs to help guide us through the day.

DaisyBill Mission
Workers' Comp Made Better
If you are injured at work, most industrialized countries establish workers' compensation systems that require your employer to provide for all of your care and treatment while you recover. In the United States, each state sets up its own workers' compensation rules for employers to assume financial responsibility for your care.
The world would be a better place if injured employees could access the best medical treatment and services. Unfortunately, the complexities of workers' comp often frustrate and discourage medical providers; as a result, many providers refuse to treat employees injured while at work.
DaisyBill is built for these providers and eliminates many of the frustrating complexities that burden the process of getting paid by employers for the services and treatment needed by injured employees.
Our clients are our number one priority; they stay with us because we constantly keep our clients top of mind as we develop technology to make their workers' comp billing world so much easier and better. We adore our clients and our clients adore us - they make DaisyBill the best at what we do.
DaisyBill was founded in 2012 and is an established and profitable niche enterprise B2B technology company. We preserve many of the benign characteristics that fueled our early start-up days but without the worries of answering to outside equity.
The DaisyBill Team devotes all of our collective expertise, talent, and resources to the pursuit of our mission of improving injured employees' access to the very best medical care.

We set out to tackle this education crisis with a groundbreaking school design that delivers a rigorous, whole-child education to students from all backgrounds. Today, as the fastest growing, highest-performing charter school network in New York, our network of 47 K-12 schools outperforms every district in the state, proving irrefutably that all children are capable of excellence.
Job Description
Position Description: Data Analyst
The mission of Success Academies is to reimagine public education. From the classroom to the halls of government, this means finding profoundly different approaches to how we structure, implement and support schooling. We reconceive every aspect of school design, from writing rigorous new curricula to drawing regularly on the advances in technology and business that are transforming every sector except education.
Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children – mostly poor and minority – are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country. At 100 schools, we will graduate 3,000 scholars each year who are prepared to enter, persist and graduate from college and eventually to lead in business, government and civic realms.

To further position the organization for this rapid growth, Success Academies must reimagine the way work is done across both the enterprise and our network of schools - valorizing simplification, efficiency and effectiveness. To help the organization make these necessary shifts and radically improve enterprise-wide performance, Success Academies established the Success Edge Office to promote and facilitate the implementation of proven continuous improvement methods and tools, and thereby root out inefficiencies and wasteful work. Data & Analytics capability is needed to put in place a baseline of actionable management reporting that adheres to high reporting standards, generates standard and ad-hoc reporting, and performs meaningful analytics.
The Data Analyst reports to the Leader of Success Edge.
In this role, you will:
Monitor relevant Key Performance Indicators to track and measure outcomes and impact;
Apply the standard enterprise continuous improvement methodology to daily work;
Apply effective project and change management processes to drive radical improvements;
Monitor and manage metrics and reporting for EDGE Office, including daily, weekly and monthly reporting, data summaries, and trend analysis; and
Produce actionable data insights for our enterprise in the form of interactive dashboards and visualizations, ad hoc reports and analysis.
Continuously partner with Network and School-based staff to understand school and business data needs and translate those requirements into high-quality work.
The Data Analyst must work closely with a broad base of constituencies across Success Academies and will be expected to exhibit...
Teamwork and collaboration;
Strong communication skills with the ability to effectively communicate in both written and verbal forms;
Results orientation;
Influence skills in order to drive understanding and adoption;
An ease to challenge thinking and assumptions; and
An eagerness to learn and take feedback to grow and achieve full potential.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our organization. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Job Description
Position Description: Data Analyst
The mission of Success Academies is to reimagine public education. From the classroom to the halls of government, this means finding profoundly different approaches to how we structure, implement and support schooling. We reconceive every aspect of school design, from writing rigorous new curricula to drawing regularly on the advances in technology and business that are transforming every sector except education.
Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children – mostly poor and minority – are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country. At 100 schools, we will graduate 3,000 scholars each year who are prepared to enter, persist and graduate from college and eventually to lead in business, government and civic realms.

To further position the organization for this rapid growth, Success Academies must reimagine the way work is done across both the enterprise and our network of schools - valorizing simplification, efficiency and effectiveness. To help the organization make these necessary shifts and radically improve enterprise-wide performance, Success Academies established the Success Edge Office to promote and facilitate the implementation of proven continuous improvement methods and tools, and thereby root out inefficiencies and wasteful work.
